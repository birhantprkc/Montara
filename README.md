## Sixty seconds in

```bash
pnpm run montara make --seconds 20 "Explain why the sky is blue"
```

A real 1920×1080 H.264 MP4 lands in `out/` in **under three seconds** — no API key, no sign-up,
no network call. Then Montara grades its own work and tells you the truth about it:

```text
warn: slideshow risk medium (0.69): 100% of visuals have no motion or transitions;
      2 static holds longer than 5s; no audio track (silent slideshow)
```

**That verdict is the product.** The floor always renders something valid; the gates tell you when
the floor isn't good enough yet. Everything else in Montara exists to answer that warning — and it
all operates on the same JSON timeline the first command just wrote:

```bash
montara cut out/timeline.json split shot-2 4.5                  # editorial ops on the IR
montara fx pip screen.mp4 webcam.mp4 --ellipse                  # layered composition, masks, collage
montara matte walk.mp4 out/matte.mp4                            # subject cutout, no green screen
montara hear stems interview.mp4 out/stems --two-stems vocals   # pull the voice out of the music
montara reel source.mp4 out/short.mp4 --style cinematic         # captions, hook, −14 LUFS master
montara export out/timeline.json --to otio out/edit.otio        # finish in Resolve or Premiere
```

The films at the top of this page are what that toolchain produces. Nothing in this repo renders a
demo it cannot also render for you.

## Why Montara

Most video tools give you a timeline you cannot address and a render you cannot explain.
Montara's bet is the opposite: **the project is a JSON file, and every capability is a
function over it.**

| | What that buys you |
| --- | --- |
| **One IR, every output** | The same timeline renders 16:9, 9:16, 4:5, and 1:1 — *reframed, not letterboxed* — and exports to EDL, OTIO, and FCPXML. [See the same edit at two aspects ↓](#craft-reel-timeline-ir--compositor) |
| **Works with zero keys** | FFmpeg floor, system TTS, local models. Cloud providers are BYOK and opt-in — Montara never quietly spends your money. |
| **Never fakes a render** | If Blender or Manim isn't installed, Montara says so and degrades to a path that still produces a real MP4. The engine-matrix demo exists to prove this in public. |
| **Agent-native, not agent-bolted-on** | Humans, Claude, Codex, or a local Ollama model read the same `skills/` and drive the same CLI, leaving inspectable artifacts at every stage. |
| **Real models, honestly gated** | RVM / SAM 2.1 / YOLO11 for matting and tracking, Demucs for stem separation, faster-whisper for captions — each probed at runtime, never vendored, never assumed. |
| **Proof, not adjectives** | 409 offline assertions, 107 gates that render real MP4s and re-probe them, and 12 checked-in demo films you can play before reading a line of code. |

Montara is built for explainers, reels, software demos, documentaries, trailers, and motion
graphics today — and is architected to scale the same IR toward long-form work. That last part
is a roadmap, and this README marks it as one.

## What you can make with it

Montara is a general video production substrate, not a single-format demo app.
Each row states its **current** truth, not its ambition.

| Format | Current truth |
| --- | --- |
| Animated explainers | Tested through `montara make`, Timeline IR, FFmpeg/Remotion fallback, and validate MP4s. |
| YouTube Shorts / Reels | Tested through reel helpers, vertical output profiles, transcript-bound cut gates, and demo artifacts. |
| Documentary montage | Tested with offline fixture corpus and a 60-second open-stock proof. Live publication footage depends on source adapters and licensing review. |
| Screen demos / product walkthroughs | Tested via capture artifact pickup and browser-capture CLI surfaces. Live Playwright recording is runtime-gated. |
| Kinetic typography | HyperFrames strict smoke is validate-gated when runtime is present; Motion Canvas native proof remains runtime-gated. |
| Character animation | SVG/GSAP rig to HyperFrames final MP4 is validate-gated when HyperFrames is present. |
| 3D / math / cinematic scenes | Three.js, Blender, Manim, Revideo, Motion Canvas adapters exist; native proof quality varies by installed runtime. |
| Long documentaries and movies | The IR, pipelines, corpus, provider, and runtime layers are designed for this. Full 12-minute/1-hour production workflows still need longer-form validation, shot continuity, asset budgeting, and heavier QA. |

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 18+; Node 22+ recommended for some runtime tooling
- `pnpm`
- FFmpeg and ffprobe on `PATH`
- Python 3.10+ for the Python media engine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhinavshrivastava950/Montara.git
cd Montara
pnpm install
python -m pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
copy .env.example .env
pnpm run montara doctor
pnpm run montara start
```

Windows shortcut:

```bat
scripts\setup.bat
```

`pnpm run montara start` runs `doctor` first, so missing FFmpeg or workspace
dependencies are caught before a render starts. Use `pnpm run montara doctor
--fix` for guided setup commands, or `pnpm run montara doctor --fix --yes` to
run project-local install steps.

PowerShell-friendly commands:

```powershell
pnpm run montara doctor
pnpm run montara status --json --out out/montara-status.json
pnpm run montara make --pipeline animated-explainer --seconds 20 "Explain Montara's Timeline IR"
```

No API key is required for the basic local path. Add keys only for the providers
you want to test.

## Studio Flow

`montara start` is the beginner-facing entry point:

```text
Montara is started.
What can I do for you today?

  1. Create videos
  2. Edit videos

How would you like to make your video?
  1. Instagram Reel
  2. YouTube Short
  3. YouTube video
  4. Documentary
  5. Animated explainer
  6. Screen demo
```

Non-interactive example:

```bash
pnpm run montara start --non-interactive create \
  --kind documentary \
  --niche geopolitics \
  --topic "Why chokepoints still shape global trade" \
  --seconds 60
```

## Public Demo Gallery

Committed MP4s live under `demos/*.mp4` (allowlisted in `.gitignore`). Working
renders and caches stay under `out/` and are not committed. The old low-motion
text-card clips were removed from the public gallery.

### Craft reel (Timeline IR + compositor)

Sources: `demos/01-relight.mjs` … `demos/05-audio.mjs`. Run with `node demos/run.mjs`.

| Demo | What it proves | MP4 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Relight / matte | RVM (or YOLO→SAM 2) subject matte, ground plate, text reveal behind the subject | 16:9 [03-relight.mp4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhinavshrivastava950/Montara/main/demos/03-relight.mp4) · [poster](demos/posters/03-relight-poster.jpg) |

| Depth | Layered text + subject depth composite | [06-depth.mp4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhinavshrivastava950/Montara/main/demos/06-depth.mp4) · [poster](demos/posters/06-depth-poster.jpg) |

The relight pair is the clearest statement of the core bet: **one Timeline IR, many
deliveries.** `03-relight.mp4` (1920×1080) and `03-relight-4x5.mp4` (1080×1350) are the
same 9.37s edit re-resolved per aspect — the subject stays framed and the matte still
holds the title behind him. Neither is a letterboxed crop of the other.

The engine matrix is deliberately honest: it demonstrates FFmpeg and Remotion as
local render paths, and it shows HyperFrames, Blender, Three.js, Manim, Revideo,
Motion Canvas, and Playwright with their actual shipped adapter/probe/runtime
status. It does not fake a native Blender, Manim, Revideo, or Motion Canvas
render when that runtime is not installed.

### Vision models (background removal and friends)

Background removal is **not** a single fixed checkpoint — `montara matte` /
`autoMatte` pick the best path the machine can run:

| Family | Role | Variants | Why / when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **RVM** (Robust Video Matting) | Primary **background removal** for video | `rvm-mobilenetv3` (CPU-friendly default), `rvm-resnet50` (higher edge/hair fidelity, needs GPU) | Purpose-built for **temporally stable** video mattes without a green screen. Preferred over still-image removers that flicker frame-to-frame. |
| **SAM 2.1** | Promptable / tracked masks (roto), not first-line BG removal | `sam2.1-hiera-tiny` → `small` → `base-plus` → `large` | Click/box/auto masks with video tracking (`montara segment`). Also used as **YOLO-seeded fallback** when RVM is unavailable. |
| **YOLO11** | Detection + auto-framing prompts | `yolo11n` → `s` → `m` → `x` | Finds subjects to seed SAM 2 or drive framing (`montara detect`). Not a matting model by itself. |
| **Chromakey** | Last-resort fallback | FFmpeg `chromakey` | Real green/blue screen only; no learned weights. |

Order for `autoMatte`: **RVM → YOLO+SAM 2 → optional chromakey → opaque**. Weights stay outside the repo; `montara models plan` / hardware gates refuse downloads the machine cannot run. Licenses: RVM GPL-3.0 (weights on their model card), SAM 2 Apache-2.0, YOLO11 AGPL-3.0 (Ultralytics).

### Audio models (source separation)

Vision separates picture layers; **Demucs** separates audio layers. Reach for it when the voice and
the music are already baked into one file — an EQ cannot unmix a mix.

| | **Multiband enhance** (`montara enhance`) | **Source separation** (`montara hear stems`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input | one dirty voice take | a full mix (VO + music + room) |
| Splits by | **frequency bands** — clean each band's noise | **content** — into separate tracks |
| Output | still **one** cleaned waveform | **multiple** files you can mute, duck, or rebalance |
| Needs | FFmpeg only | Python + Demucs weights (RAM/VRAM gated, like RVM) |

```bash
montara hear stems mix.wav out/stems --two-stems vocals   # vocals + no_vocals
```

Verified end-to-end on Montara's own demo mix: separating narration-over-music and transcribing each
stem returns the full 25-word VO from `vocals.wav` and **silence** from `no_vocals.wav`. Runtime-gated
like every model path — without `pip install demucs`, `montara enhance` remains the always-available
floor and the separation command says so instead of failing. See
[`skills/creative/source-separation.md`](skills/creative/source-separation.md).

Regenerate engine-gallery demos:

```bash
pnpm demos:generate
```

Regenerate the craft / SaaS reel (needs FFmpeg; optional ElevenLabs / Pexels keys in `.env`):

```bash
node demos/run.mjs
# or one film: node demos/07-linkedin.mjs
```

The gallery generator uses only keys present in `.env`. It does not require paid
voice/music APIs; `MONTARA_TTS_PROVIDER=system` is the default demo voice path.

## What Is Tested Today

Local gate snapshot, measured 2026-08-08 on Windows 11 / Node 22 / Python 3.13:

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm typecheck` | 0 errors |
| `pnpm verify` | 409 passed, 0 failed |
| `pnpm validate` | 107 passed, 0 failed |
| `pnpm run montara doctor` | ready to render |
| `pnpm run montara stage1-audit --json --out out/stage1-audit.json` | 4/4 sections, 21/21 checks |
| `python -m pytest tests` | not rerun on this pass — the local Python 3.13 interpreter has no `pytest`; last recorded Stage 4 gate was 399 passed, 8 skipped |

`verify` is pure/offline assertions; `validate` renders real MP4s and re-probes them,
so it is the slower gate and the one that catches a broken encoder path.

These tests cover:

- Timeline IR validation, editing operations, render paths, and editor bridge export/import
- FFmpeg real MP4 rendering and post-render QA
- Remotion native smoke when installed and FFmpeg fallback when not
- HyperFrames kinetic and character-rig paths when available
- provider request builders, redaction, dry-run/live-audit plumbing
- local fallbacks for video/image/speech/music
- corpus/search/compose workflows for documentary montage
- Playwright/capture command surfaces and Python capture tests
- documentary evidence gates and transcript-safe short cuts

Not fully tested yet:

- real live-key confirmation for every cloud provider
- full feature-length movie workflows
- installed-runtime native proofs for every renderer on every OS
- BLIP/default local vision captioning beyond optional CLIP/signalstats paths
- public SDK and GUI/WARCUT product surfaces

## Provider Surface

Montara exposes many provider paths, but it is careful about the word
"supported":

- **Verified offline:** request shape, redaction, fallback behavior, and dry-run
  ledger are tested.
- **Live confirmed:** a real key was used recently and a sanitized artifact was
  recorded.
- **Runtime-gated:** it works only if you installed the local runtime or model.
- **Planned:** the architecture has a slot, but it should not be sold as shipped.

Current registry surface:

| Category | Providers / runtimes | Current truth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Video cloud | Kling, Runway Gen-4.5, Google Veo 3.1, xAI Grok Video, Higgsfield, MiniMax, HeyGen | request builders + sanitized fixtures; real-key confirmations still BYOK follow-up |
| Video local | WAN, Hunyuan, CogVideo, LTX via ComfyUI | runtime manager and request surface; actual quality depends on local GPU/models |
| Stock video | Pexels, Pixabay, Wikimedia | Pexels/Pixabay key paths; Wikimedia keyless network opt-in |
| Image cloud | BFL FLUX.2, Google Gemini image, xAI Grok image, OpenAI Images, Recraft | request builders + sanitized fixtures; live confirmation per key |
| Image local/stock | Stable Diffusion via ComfyUI/A1111, Manim frames, Pexels, Pixabay, Unsplash | runtime/stock gated |
| TTS | system voice, Piper, ElevenLabs, Google TTS, OpenAI TTS, Doubao Speech in Python tools | system/local fallbacks tested; cloud request builders and tools require keys |
| Music/SFX | tone-score fallback, Suno, ElevenLabs Music, ElevenLabs SFX | fallback tested; cloud paths BYOK/live-audit gated |
| STT/captions | Groq Whisper when key exists, faster-whisper when installed | Groq path is implemented; local faster-whisper remains runtime-gated |
| Source separation | Demucs (`htdemucs`, `htdemucs_ft`, `mdx_extra`) | local-only, no key; runtime-gated on `pip install demucs`, weights fetched on first run |

Before spending money, run:

```bash
pnpm run montara providers audit --out out/provider-audit-fixtures.json
pnpm run montara providers live-audit --out out/provider-live-audit.json
pnpm run montara providers smoke flux --category image --json
```

Live calls require:

```bash
MONTARA_LIVE_PROVIDER_SMOKE=1
```

plus the provider key and `--live`.

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. The example file intentionally lists more than
the demo minimum so a founder, evaluator, or agent can see the provider surface.
Empty values are safe; Montara falls back locally when keys are absent.

Never commit `.env`, auth state files, model weights, customer media, or private
generated outputs.

## Core Commands

```bash
pnpm run montara doctor
pnpm run montara status --json --out out/montara-status.json
pnpm run montara stage1-audit --json --out out/stage1-audit.json
pnpm run montara start
pnpm run montara plan "Make a 45-second explainer about why the sky is blue"

```

## Engines And Runtimes

| Engine/runtime | Role | Current status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FFmpeg | universal assembly, encode, probe, audio, thumbnails, shorts | working local floor |
| Remotion | React motion graphics, explainer/documentary compositions | native smoke validate-gated when composer deps installed; `REMOTION_ENABLED=1` opts in |
| HyperFrames | HTML/CSS/GSAP kinetic typography and character SVG rigs | validate-gated when `npx hyperframes` resolves |
| Blender | external 3D rendering | adapter exists; native runtime-gated |
| Three.js | headless/WebGL 3D proofs | adapter exists; runtime-gated/fallback path |
| Manim | math/diagram animation | adapter exists; runtime-gated |
| Revideo | MIT composition fallback target | selector/probe exists; installed MP4 proof pending |
| Motion Canvas | kinetic typography target | adapter/probe exists; installed MP4 proof pending |
| Playwright | browser capture, login storageState | CLI and tests exist; live browser runtime-gated |
| ComfyUI / A1111 | local image/video model servers | external runtime manager, dry-run install/launch guidance |
| Piper / faster-whisper / Transformers.js | local TTS, STT, CLIP-style vision | runtime inventory and optional paths |

Montara never vendors model weights. Keep runtimes, caches, and model licenses
outside the repository.

## Architecture

```text
idea/source/reference
  -> research / understand / hear
  -> pipeline skills
  -> ScenePlan / edit decisions
  -> Timeline IR
  -> renderer adapter
  -> MP4 + QA + self-review
  -> optional EDL / OTIO / FCPXML
```

The Python engine at repo root (`tools/`, `lib/`, `pipeline_defs/`, `schemas/`)
is driven through `engine_bridge.py` and the TypeScript CLI. The TypeScript side
owns the IR, provider registry, render adapters, gates, and public command
surface.

## Repository Layout

The root stays intentionally small. Runtime-critical entrypoints remain at the
top level, while reference docs and helper scripts live under their own folders.

| Path | What belongs there |
| --- | --- |
| `README.md`, `PLAN.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `AGENT_GUIDE.md` | first-read project and agent contracts |
| `packages/` | TypeScript workspaces: CLI, IR, renderers, providers, quality gates |
| `tools/`, `lib/`, `schemas/`, `pipeline_defs/`, `skills/` | Python media engine and shared skill layer; kept at root for bridge compatibility |
| `remotion-composer/` | native Remotion composition project and demo compositions |
| `scripts/` | verification, validation, demo generation, and legacy demo render helpers |
| `docs/` | architecture, provider docs, prompt gallery, attribution, launch notes |
| `demos/` | checked-in public MP4s, posters, and demo manifest only |
| `out/`, `projects/`, `.python-packages/`, `.pnpm-store/` | local generated/runtime state; ignored |

## Roadmap

What is already solid:

- Timeline IR core
- FFmpeg render floor
- editor export/import
- Stage 1 parity audit
- provider request fixtures and live-readiness ledger
- public demo gallery
- documentary evidence gates
- local-brain fallback path for `montara make --brain`

What still needs hardening:

- real BYOK live smokes for the long-tail cloud providers
- Motion Canvas and Revideo installed-runtime MP4 proofs
- full cached local CLIP/BLIP vision validation
- longer documentary/film-scale workflows with continuity and budget QA
- public SDK
- `montara serve` web GUI
- WARCUT desktop GUI on the same IR

## Repository Hygiene

Tracked on purpose:

- source code, skills, docs, schemas, tests
- public demo MP4s/posters in `demos/`
- demo manifest and reproducible generator script

Ignored on purpose:

- `.env`, auth state, service-account files, API tokens
- `out/`, `projects/`, scratch outputs, private generated media
- model weights, ONNX/GGUF files, runtime caches
- demo scratch workspace `demos/.work/` and demo generation logs
